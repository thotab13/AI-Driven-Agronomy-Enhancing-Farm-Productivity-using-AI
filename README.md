Agriculture is crucial to the economy, contributing considerably to GDP and employing a large workforce. Nonetheless, precisely projecting food production and demand
remains a difficult task. Traditional prediction approaches are time-consuming and
prone to errors, resulting in inefficient resource allocation and financial losses. To
solve these issues, we offer an innovative platform that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the best crops for production based on environmental conditions, as
well as forecast market demand and pricing patterns for those crops.It contain four
main modules these are The Crop Prediction module uses machine learning and historical data to forecast crop growth, helping farmers make informed decisions to increase
yields. The Crop Price Prediction module applies predictive analytics to predict market trends and price changes, assisting farmers in strategic planning. The Fertiliser
Prediction module use data-driven algorithms to predict the best fertiliser mixtures
and application rates depending on soil nutrients, crop needs, and environmental factors. The Crop Yield Prediction module uses machine learning and historical data to
forecast yields prior to harvest, assisting farmers in optimising resource allocation and
production plans.A tiny gadget with integrated sensors evaluates critical soil properties
and delivers real-time data on environmental conditions and soil health. This real-time
data enables farmers to precisely monitor crop growth and perform appropriate interventions, such as irrigation scheduling and soil treatment adjustments, to increase crop
quality and production. This technology enables farmers to make data-driven decisions
and promotes sustainable agricultural practices in a tough and changing environment
by integrating real-time monitoring with predictive capabilities.
